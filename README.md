# COVID-19-Statistics #

A Python script that shows real-time COVID-19 statistics in human-readable tabular form via source data from the web.

# Libraries/Modules used:
1. *requests* (dependency)
2. *csv*
3. *os*
4. *platform*
5. *datetime*

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The program supports Windows, Mac or any GNU/Linux distribution.
2. Make sure Python(3.5<) is installed in your system
3. IMPORTANT: Kindly have *requests* module installed. This can be done by running ```pip3 install requests``` in command line
4. It is recommended to run the scripts in command line, not in IDLE (tabular data may get distorted)

# HOW TO RUN:
1. The .zip file contains two .py files, *core.py*, *COVID19.py*, and a standalone .exe file
2. *core.py* file is not executable and only contains modules for the script to run
3. Kindly run covid.py file to run the script (NOTE: Do make sure that both core.py and covid.py are in a common(same) directory!!)
4. You may also run the standalone *COVID19_Statistics.exe* file instead of the *COVID19.py* script.
