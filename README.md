# COVID-19-Statistics
Python script that shows real-time COVID-19 statistics in human-readable tabular form via source data from the web.

# Libraries/Modules used:
# --> requests (dependency)
# --> csv
# --> os
# --> platform
# --> datetime

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# --> The program supports Windows, Mac or any GNU/Linux distribution.
# --> Make sure Python(3.5<) is installed in your system
# --> IMPORTANT: Kindly have 'requests' module installed. This can be done by running 'pip3 install requests' in command line
# --> It is recommended to run the scripts in command line, not in IDLE (tabular data may get distorted)

# HOW TO RUN:
# --> The .zip file contains two .py files, "core.py", "COVID19.py", and a standalone .exe file
# --> core.py file is not executable and only contains modules for the script to run
# --> Kindly run covid.py file to run the script (NOTE: Do make sure that both core.py and covid.py are in a common(same) directory!!)
# --> You may also run the standalone 'COVID19_Statistics.exe' file instead of the "COVID19.py" script.
